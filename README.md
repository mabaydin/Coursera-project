#COVID-19 vaccination data analysis
COVID-19 vaccination is a burning question, and still, thousands of people are dying worldwide
every day. To bring this pandemic to an end, a large share of the world needs to be immune to
the virus. The safest way to achieve this is with a vaccine. This dashboard aims to visualize COVID19 vaccination in different countries and the average monthly vaccination rate in 2021. The
"covid-world-vaccination-progress" dataset represents the vaccination type, vaccination
manufacturers, and the number of vaccinated people. It is visible that Pfizer/BioNTech is the
widely used vaccination in Germany, and there was an increasing average monthly vaccination
rate until June. However, the average monthly vaccination rate started falling from July and hit
the lowest since February in October.
